#For diff drive (the only currently supported drive mode)
#1)add ""position2d:0"" to the provides section
#2)add "drive "differential""
#3)add "rightwheel "portletter"" where portletter is A,B, or C 
#4)add "leftwheel "portletter"" where portletter is A,B, or C 
#
#For sonar sensors
#1)add ""sonar:0"" to the provides section
#2)add "sonarcount "numsonars"" where numsonars is the number of sonars
#3)add "sonarports ["4""2"]" if sonars are in ports 2 and 4
# 
#For light sensors
#1)add ""light:::ranger:0"" to the provides section you need to increment 0 for multiple rangers(sound, light, etc..)
#2)add "lightsensorcount "numlights"" where numlights is the number of lights
#3)add "lightsensorports ["1""2"]" if sonars are in ports 1 and 2
#
#For sound sensors
#1)add ""sound:::ranger:0"" to the provides section you need to increment 0 for multiple rangers(sound, light, etc..)
#2)add "soundsensorcount "numsound"" where numsound is the number of sounds
#3)add "soundsensorports ["1""2""3""4"]" if sonars are in ports 1,2,3, and 4
#
#For bumper sensors
#1)add ""bumper:0"" to the provides section you need to increment 0 for multiple rangers(sound, light, etc..)
#2)add "bumpercount "numbumper"" where numbumper is the number of bumpers
#3)add "bumperports ["4""2""3""1"]" if sonars are in ports 1,2,3, and 4
#
#in case you didnt notice order of sensors dosnt matter player will recognise them in the order you list them here...
#
#For Gripper
#1)add "gripperport "portletter"" where portletter is A,B, or C 
#2)add "gripperangle "integer"" where integer represents how many degrees the motor needs to turn to open or close the gripper
#if open and close are reversed, use a negative angle or recunstruct gripper. (open and close can reverse based on how you build your gripper!)
